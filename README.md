 Authentication & Role-Based Access

Authentication is handled via JWT.

JWTs are generated at login and sent in the Authorization header as:

Authorization: Bearer <token>


Role-based access:

Users with role "admin" can:

View all users

Delete any user

Change user roles

Regular users can only access their own data (not implemented in this version but can be added).
